# bmp-reverse
bmp-reverse is a simple java program that turns takes in a BMP file and outputs the image in its negative image. 

## Usage
To use bmp-reverse, run the following in command line:
```
java bmp filename
```
Where *filename* is the BMP file that you want to reverse. 
Remember to include *.bmp* inside of *filename*.
The program will output the resulting image in the same directory with the same name as the *filename* but with *_reverse* appended at the end.

## Possible Improvements
Depending on the needs of the users, some of the features I would add include:
* Support reversing multiple images, either by iterating through a directory or specifying multiple files in the command line, with one run. 
* Custom output file name.
